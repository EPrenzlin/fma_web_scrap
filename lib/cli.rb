#this will be the CLI 
#just like the call method from the Music CLI class. 

#cli plan is like a database of sorts. 
#plan - user opens up the program he/ she will see some logo I put together. 
#given some options which will be numbered : see all state alchesmiits, their ranks, their state_name, which chapter they appear in. 
# or see each one individually and their information. 
# If the user wants more info on the character, a summary of that chapter, or brief intro on the character themselves can also be called.
